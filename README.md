# NAPDE_PINNs_FluidDynamics

## Last Improvements
- Reduced Loss Graph
- Now input can be given by a .txt
- New way of test savings
- Full code refactoring

## To do list:
- Refactor the code for Poiseuille and Colliding
- Generate plots with many epochs (until plateau of losses)
- Implementation of PRESS_0
- Begin report (PoliMi template article, single column)

## Further ideas
- Prediction of the exact value of the BC plateau, noisy case
- Restyle of losses plot (as for June presentation)
- Take the same collocation points of initial time for the unsteady case
- Different type of sampling
