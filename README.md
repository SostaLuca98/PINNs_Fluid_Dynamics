# NAPDE_PINNs_FluidDynamics

## To do list:
- Refactor the code for the time-independent case (cavity)
- Then, modify Poiseuille and Colliding
- Generate plots with many epochs (until plateau of losses)
- Implementation of PRESS_0
- Begin report (PoliMi template article, single column)

## Further ideas
- Prediction of the exact value of the BC plateau, noisy case
- Restyle of losses plot (as for June presentation)
- Take the same collocation points of initial time for the unsteady case
- Different type of sampling
